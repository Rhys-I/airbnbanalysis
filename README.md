# 🏙️ NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores Airbnb listings across New York City to identify key drivers of price and profitability. Using a dataset from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com), I analyzed over 37,000 listings across boroughs, host types, and room types. The goal is to uncover what makes a listing successful and how hosts can optimize their strategies.
This project explores short-term rental listings in New York City using data-driven techniques to uncover pricing trends, host behaviors, and neighborhood-level insights. The goal is to identify patterns that can help hosts and investors optimize their listings for profitability and competitiveness.

## 🔍 Project Summary

Using the NYC Airbnb Open Data set, I conducted:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to profile listings by borough, room type, and host status  
- Regression analysis to explore the relationship between accommodates and revenue  
- K-Means clustering to segment listings by pricing and location features  
- Visual storytelling in Tableau to present findings interactively

## 🔍 Data Source
- [Inside Airbnb – NYC listings](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
- Data pulled for NYC, containing over 37,000 entries
- Fields used: price, room type, accommodates, reviews per month, availability, superhost status, and neighborhood group
## 📊 Key Findings

- 💰 **Superhosts earn more**: Superhost listings tend to charge higher prices and have higher occupancy.  
- 🗺️ **Location drives pricing**: Manhattan and Brooklyn listings command premium rates compared to Queens or the Bronx.  
- 🛏️ **Accommodates ≠ Revenue**: More guests doesn’t always mean more revenue — diminishing returns kick in for larger properties.  
- 📌 **Clusters revealed segments**: K-means clustering highlighted 3 main listing types: budget private rooms, mid-range entire homes, and high-end properties.

## 📈 Analysis Summary
- Entire home/apartment listings command the highest average prices
- Superhost listings tend to charge more, likely due to added trust
- Central neighborhoods like SoHo and Tribeca show premium pricing
- Listings with more consistent reviews are correlated with higher prices
- Clustering revealed distinct listing types (budget, mid-range, premium)
## ✅ Next Steps

- Include seasonal or time-based price trends  
- Integrate sentiment analysis from review texts  
- Compare NYC listings to other major cities for benchmarking

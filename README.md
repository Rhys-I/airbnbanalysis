# 🏙️ NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores Airbnb listings across New York City to identify key drivers of price and profitability. Using a dataset from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com), I analyzed over 37,000 listings across boroughs, host types, and room types. The goal is to uncover what makes a listing successful and how hosts can optimize their strategies.

## 📊 Key Questions
- What room types and host statuses are most profitable?
- How does location influence price?
- Do listings with more reviews tend to charge more?
- Is there a relationship between accommodates and revenue?
- Can we segment Airbnb listings into meaningful clusters?

## 🔍 Project Summary

Using the NYC Airbnb Open Data set, I conducted:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to profile listings by borough, room type, and host status  
- **Regression analysis** to examine the relationship between accommodates and revenue  
- **K-Means clustering** to segment listings by pricing and location features  
- **Interactive dashboarding in Tableau** to present key findings visually

## 📊 Key Findings

- 💰 **Superhosts earn more** — Superhost listings tend to charge higher prices and maintain higher occupancy rates.  
- 🗺️ **Location drives pricing** — Manhattan and Brooklyn listings command premium rates compared to Queens or the Bronx.  
- 🛏️ **Accommodates ≠ Revenue** — Hosting more guests doesn’t always lead to more revenue; diminishing returns often occur in larger properties.  
- 📌 **Clusters reveal market segments** — K-Means clustering identified three key listing types: budget private rooms, mid-range entire homes, and high-end luxury properties.
